# Major Project Beta Testing

## Not CS person

- the flowers did'nt grow
- the prices of the pots are hard to see
- Your money could be displayed in more places then just the store
- The season in the journal are confusing
- it wont let you collect your flowers if you are "holding" the fertilizer

### What i did to fix it:

- i fixed the issue that was causing the flowers to not grow, then i let her continue testing the game
- i had wanted to change this issue from the start, by displaying the images from right to left, but i could not get it to work at all. If i have time, i might change the images so the tag is less out to the side and falls lower instead.
- i added your money to the greenhouse and to the shop
- i took them out, i had added them in because i was going to add that atribute but i didnt have time, and the colors work the same way.
- i changed the if statement in the mousePressed function that calls the fertilize function to check if the plant isnt done 

## CS person

- the game is confusing and there isnt enough instructions
- "maybe it needs a cool soundtrack. like topgun music"
- the sound is sometimes distorted, but my dad thought it was my laptop, not the code
- you can sell the empty vase

## what i did to fix it:

- i added a page with instructions, but its not very much and you have to know to click on it. I think maybe my dad was struggleing more then normal because my sister figured it out no problem
- it has music, the sound was off..
- i played the game some more but couldnt figure out what he meant
- i fixed that so there has to be a flower in the vase
