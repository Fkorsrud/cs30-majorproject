- "pick" the flowers (maybe more then one per pot, like bunches of them) once they are done and store them
- put the flowers in pots/vases/jars or whatever
- sell the flowers
- have money
- different type of flowers
- cat to pet
- a "store" to buy things
- have things to buy with the money like seeds or decorations 
- stores seeds/ not an infinite amount of seeds

- buy more pots to grow more flowers at a time
- buy fertilizer to make them grow faster
