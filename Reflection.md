#Major Project reflection

I finished everything on my needs to have list. I also finished everything on my nice to have list, except i didnt add pictures of the characters becuase i could'nt draw people, but you can "talk" to them so i think its good enough. I struggled with saving the game with local storage. I did'nt realise you couldnt save images for a while, which caused me some issues. I made it so once the pots are taken from storage it sets the time to the begining of the "stage". This was an issue i probably could have done better. I also made used width and height determined by the width and the height of the canvas to center and resize my game, but it only works properly if the length is bigger then the height. I also could have probably fixed this by thinking about it a bit more but i did'nt. If i were to give myself if i were to start a project like this again would be to draw the drawing i wanted sooner. I had wanted to add wallpaper that you could change in the shop, but i did'nt have time to draw them.
